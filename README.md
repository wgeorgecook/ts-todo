# ts-todo
A simple React app using Hooks and Typescript

## Running it locally
I used Yarn to bootstrap this with Create React App. To run it locally, copy the repository and run `yarn install` to install dependencies. Then `yarn start` to get it going. It'll open a browser window with the app running in it.
